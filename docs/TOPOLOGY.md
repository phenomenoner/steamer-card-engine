# Topology

This document is a **structure + boundaries map** for `steamer-card-engine`.

It’s intentionally practical: where things live, which files are contracts vs placeholders, and what the sharp edges are right now.

## “Docs-first” boundary (what is contract vs stub)

### Contracts (source of truth for semantics)

- `AGENTS.md` — contributor/agent protocol for safe repo work and claims discipline
- `docs/SETUP.md` — install/bootstrap and current safe command surface
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — planes, boundaries, intended components
- `docs/CARD_SPEC.md` — card + intent contract (fields + behavior rules)
- `docs/ADAPTER_SPEC.md` — market/broker normalization + routing expectations
- `docs/AUTH_AND_SESSION_MODEL.md` — logical session + capability posture
- `docs/DAYTRADING_GUARDRAILS.md` — emergency stop / forced exit / flatten policy
- `docs/CLI_SPEC.md` — intended CLI families + governance stance
- `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` — phase slicing and dependency ordering
- `docs/MILESTONE_M1_SIM_COMPARABILITY.md` — bounded milestone plan for replay/live-sim artifact comparability
- `docs/M1_SIM_COMPARABILITY_FOUNDATION_PACK.md` — baseline inventory + comparison contract v0 + sprint-ready stage ordering for M1 execution
- `docs/SIM_ARTIFACT_SPEC.md` — simulation run artifacts, provenance, and checksum/index contract
- `docs/SCENARIO_SPEC.md` — shared scenario identity contract for baseline-vs-candidate comparability

### Executable seed (v0.1)

- `src/steamer_card_engine/manifest.py`
  - TOML loading + validation for: auth profile / card / deck / global
- `src/steamer_card_engine/sim_compare.py`
  - M1 foundation tooling:
    - baseline artifact normalizer (`sim normalize-baseline`)
    - comparator (`sim compare`) with hard gates + decision-grade report outputs (`compare-manifest.json`, `diff.json`, `summary.md`)
- `src/steamer_card_engine/cli.py`
  - validate/inspect CLI for manifests + M1 sim normalization/comparison commands
  - replay candidate-emission command (`replay run`) with v1 bundle output + dry-run receipt mode
  - seed operator posture controls (`status|arm-live|disarm-live|flatten|submit-order-smoke`) with local state/receipt trails
- `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_manifests.py`, `tests/test_sim_compare.py`
  - pin current CLI behaviors, validation rules, and M1 comparator hard-gate behavior
- `runs/...` + `comparisons/...`
  - committed M1 receipt artifacts (baseline bundle, candidate bundle, comparator outputs) for a 3-scenario pre-sprint evidence pack
  - compare outputs are now decision-grade (`compare-manifest.json`, `diff.json`, `summary.md`), not just placeholder plumbing
  - include both passing comparable pairs and explicit phase-3 mismatch replayability checks for hard-gate verification
  - working tree may also contain newer local run/comparison lanes (for example 2026-03-17/18/20 candidate receipts or `manual-live-paired-*` comparisons); treat those as workspace receipts until promoted into `docs/M1_EVIDENCE_PACK_INDEX.md`
  - Option B hygiene: duplicate `event-log.jsonl` payloads are symlink-deduped to canonical copies; content hashes remain unchanged

### Intentional placeholders (not yet “real runtime”)

- `src/steamer_card_engine/runtime/components.py`
  - **names** the future components, but does not implement conflict resolution / risk / execution
- operator commands now maintain a seed local posture/receipt state machine (`.state/operator_posture.json` + `.state/operator_receipts/`)
  - this is a bounded smoke/control surface, not a broker-connected production control plane

## Sharp edges / known deltas

1. **Docs are richer than current models**
   - The docs describe `Intent` / `ExecutionRequest` / `OrderLifecycleEvent` shapes that are not fully represented in `src/steamer_card_engine/models.py` yet.
   - This is expected at v0.1, but it means: treat docs as the target contract; treat code as seed scaffolding.

2. **Overlay semantics are not yet frozen**
   - Card vs deck vs global policy merge/precedence rules (tighten vs widen) are described conceptually but not fully specified as executable semantics.

3. **Replay credibility still depends on receipts**
   - `docs/SIM_ARTIFACT_SPEC.md` defines the target artifact contract (event/feature/intent/risk/execution + checksums).
   - `replay run` now emits a real candidate v1 bundle path, but current M1 behavior is still a legacy-bridge emitter rather than full native runtime behavior parity.
   - M1 baseline/candidate emission currently uses conservative placeholders for unknown legacy fields (for example qty/fill/position details when baseline artifacts do not expose them).

4. **Scenario identity is now defined, but not yet enforced by runtime**
   - `docs/SCENARIO_SPEC.md` defines the shared identity shape needed for baseline-vs-candidate comparisons.
   - M1 SIM-comparability evidence runs require `scenario-spec.json` + `scenario_fingerprint`, but enforcement is not implemented yet.
   - Current CLI/runtime paths may still accept loosely specified replay inputs; strict ScenarioSpec validation is a next-step implementation item.

5. **Authority states are only seed-grade executable posture today**
   - Docs strongly assert operator-governed live authority.
   - A bounded local state machine now exists for `disarmed` ↔ `armed-live` with TTL/auto-disarm and receipt trails.
   - It is still not broker-connected runtime authority; sim attachments remain explicitly simulated and disclosure-first.


## Cross-line ownership contract (2026-03-26)

This repo now owns the **backtest engine/product surface** for the Steamer line.

Authority split:
- `steamer-card-engine` (this repo): engine capability + productization contracts
- `StrategyExecuter .../powerhouse`: strategy experiment loop + interpretation of validation results
- `mandate-campaign-framework`: governor cadence + artifact-governance discipline

Guardrails for this repo:
- allowed: engine contracts, lineage tooling, validation-pack productization
- must not: strategy semantic promotion authority, Steamer nightly governor writes, campaign-governor cadence ownership

Canonical note:
- `docs/tech-notes/2026-03-26_backtest-loop-ownership-contract_with_strategy-powerhouse_and_mandate-framework.md`

## Where to put new work (when v0.2 starts)

- **Contract models** → `src/steamer_card_engine/models.py`
- **Schema validation & merge semantics** → `src/steamer_card_engine/manifest.py` (+ tests)
- **Replay artifacts** → new module (likely `src/steamer_card_engine/replay/`)
- **Adapters** → `src/steamer_card_engine/adapters/` (expand beyond `base.py`)
- **Runtime components** → expand `src/steamer_card_engine/runtime/` (keep execution hot-path concerns explicit)
- **CLI surface** → `src/steamer_card_engine/cli.py` and tests in `tests/test_cli.py`
